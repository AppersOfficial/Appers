    <h3 class="h2">Why is HashTag under maintenance?</h3>
    <h4 class="h2_1">There are several reasons that could have resulted in the app being stopped and going down for maintenance. The biggest reason could have been a result of bugs, such as bugs that are not possible to be resolved by users directly. So, in order for the app to continue to be used without any problems, it is in maintenance, as the developers are improving it for a possible next update.</h4>
    <h3 class="h3">How can I report a bug?</h3>
    <h4 class="h3_1">You can report a bug directly from the app, or if you prefer, go to the <a href="appersofficial.github.io/Appers/apps/HashTag/report-bug">bug report page</a>.</h4
